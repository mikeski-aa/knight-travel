<b>Your task is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

You can think of the board as having 2-dimensional coordinates. Your function would therefore look like:

knightMoves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]

</b>


<h1>How to run</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Clone repo</li>
  <li>Open main.mjs with your code editor</li>
  <li>Set sCoord (starting coord) and tCoord (target coord). The chessboard is an 8x8 grid, acceptable values range from 0-7</li>
  <li>Run main.mjs via terminal "node main.mjs"</li>
</ol>
